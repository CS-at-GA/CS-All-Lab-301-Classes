# Goals

1. Update the `Ball` class so that it keeps the ball on the screen
2. Add keyboard or mouse functionality to add ball objects
3. Add keyboard or mouse functionality to remove the last ball object added
4. **Honors**: add keyboard or mouse functionality to remove a particular ball (if you do this using a keyboard, you'll need to highlight the "selected" ball somehow)
